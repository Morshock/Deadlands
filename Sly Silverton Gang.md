The gang is lead by [[Tara Silverton]], [[Claude]] would like to lead the gang, but he is past his prime and Tara is far too clever for him to undermine.

She has nurtured a strong loyalty within the gang, despite some of them being unhinged killers.

The older veterans;
[[Lorcan]] - a fearless army vet that helps keep the gang in line during jobs, one of the better shooters in the gang.
[[Frankie the Fuse]] - while slightly unhinged and prone to setting off dymanite is still a wealth of experience for the gang, always has something to eat, drink or smoke. Though Frankies pallet is not to everyones liking.
[[Handsome Jack]]- Crafty and manipulative, he is the gangs hustler. One of the least violent members of the gang, prefering to talk his way out of situations. Still handy with a shotgun when he needs to be. Has a thing for the boss and dreams of retiring on a beach or idelic farmstead one day with her.
[[Mathew Glenn]]- One of the younger members recruited in more recent years by the boss herself. Prone to extreme violence, but extremely loyal. He is the gangs knife man, only Tara herself being his rival in that regard. He is also the gangs safe cracker and is good at 'aquiring' things.
