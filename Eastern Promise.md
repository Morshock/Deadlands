We met [[Hemrick]] and [[Claude]] having some food

Saw [Harriet Williams] on the arm of some guy

Mattew came back later on his own for a snoop around, he got a look through the door in the Eastern Promise and found the room empty, except for a man writing at a desk. he assumes there is a secret entry to a basement room that this man is guarding, as he has seen people entering which would back this theory up.


Another man has been hanging around there too and seemingly scoping it out as well. Heâ€™s a greying individual but wears a cool and calculated expression of someone with a plan to take that money for himself. He is staying nearby also. No affiliations can be seen on his dark clothing.

We were told the Sherif can be found at the Eastern Promise sometimes.
